Important first step before operating the model is to download the sandia toolbox which can be downloaded using this link: https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/PVLIB_Matlab_Help/


# To use the model of the hybrid power plant (HPP)
First the location specific resource data should be adjusted in lines: 28-34. 
Next the location's longitude and latitude needs to be changed in lines: 42-43.
If desired, the a different solar module can be plugged in. The data of the datasheet needs to be added in lines: 50-60.
The orientation of the modules is now flat on the surface. The tilt angle and azimuth can be changed in lines: 63-64.
The cost variables can be changed in lines: 66-91, if desired.

Lines: 6-8, show the amount of solar modules, kites, and loss of load. This can be adjusted to find the optimal configuration of the HPP. 
Lines: 18-19, indicate whether the loss of load is really lost or generated by the diesel generators, and whether the system is in a micro-grid or grid-connected.
